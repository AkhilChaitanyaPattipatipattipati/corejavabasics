//Treeset is perticularly for the sorting perpose.
//It allows only Homogenious and comparable objects only.
//comparable means on the top of which ever the object we are trying to to do sorting that class supposed to be
// Implements comparable then only we call it as comparable objects.
//If we are trying to do it for predifined class then we should have to use comparataor it will have compare method
// inside we will override it and implement our own logic.
//If we are trying to sort some user defined class we should have to implement that with comparable it will
// have compared to medthod inside.
//we can use the lambda expression as well for to do sorting it will have comparator.comparing both are same thing only.
